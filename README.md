# Supply Chain & Logistics Performance Analytics

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain order performance across multiple warehouses to evaluate fulfillment efficiency, cancellation trends, and pending order risks.

The objective is to replicate a real-world business analytics workflow — starting from raw data cleaning and SQL-based KPI analysis to building an interactive executive dashboard in Excel.


## Business Problem
Supply chain teams need clear visibility into operational performance. Key questions addressed in this project include:
- Which warehouse has the highest fulfillment rate?
- Where are order cancellations most frequent?
- Which warehouse shows higher pending order risk?
- How do KPIs change dynamically when warehouse selection changes?


## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel**: PivotTables, PivotCharts, KPI Cards, Slicers, Executive Dashboard  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **SQL**: KPI calculations and aggregations  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data loading and transformation  
- **CSV Files**: Supply chain datasets  


## Key KPIs
- Warehouse Fulfillment Rate (%)
- Warehouse Cancellation Rate (%)
- Warehouse Pending Order Rate (%)
- Fulfillment, Cancellation, and Pending Risk by Warehouse

All KPIs are PivotTable-driven and update dynamically using slicers.


## Dashboard Highlights
- Executive-level KPI cards
- Interactive warehouse slicer
- Dynamic charts for fulfillment, cancellation, and pending risk
- Clean and professional dashboard layout



##  Key Insights
- Fulfillment performance varies significantly across warehouses.
- Certain warehouses show higher cancellation rates, indicating process inefficiencies.
- Pending order risk highlights operational bottlenecks requiring attention.
